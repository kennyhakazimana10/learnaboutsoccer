                <p>Soccer, or football, is played between two teams of eleven players. Itâ€™s a game of skill, strategy, and teamwork. The game consists of two 45-minute halves, with a 15-minute halftime break. Key rules include the offside rule, where attacking players cannot be ahead of the second-to-last defender when the ball is passed, and fouls, which result in free kicks or penalty kicks for serious offenses.</p>
                <p>Soccer has four main positional groups: goalkeepers, who defend the goal; defenders, who protect the goal and block shots; midfielders, who transition the ball between defense and attack; and forwards (or attackers), who score goals. Each group contains several specialized roles, such as center-backs and full-backs for defenders, and strikers and wingers for forwards, with team formations dictating specific player responsibilities.</p>
