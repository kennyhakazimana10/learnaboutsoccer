            <p>Soccer, or football, is played between two teams of eleven players. Itâ€™s a game of skill, strategy, and teamwork. The game consists of two 45-minute halves, with a 15-minute halftime break. Key rules include the offside rule, where attacking players cannot be ahead of the second-to-last defender when the ball is passed, and fouls, which result in free kicks or penalty kicks for serious offenses.Soccer has four main positional groups: goalkeepers, who defend the goal; defenders, who protect the goal and block shots; midfielders, who transition the ball between defense and attack; and forwards (or attackers), who score goals. Each group contains several specialized roles, such as center-backs and full-backs for defenders, and strikers and wingers for forwards, with team formations dictating specific player responsibilities. </p>
            <p>The goal is to score by getting the ball into the opposing team's net, while preventing the other team from scoring. The fact that it's so simple probably is the reason of why it is the most popular sport on the planet. It is a frequently cited that there is an estimation of 250 million active players for association football worldwide, making it the world's most popular sport. </p>
